# Industry-Safety-Detection-using-Yolov8


It is a Case Study where we are building a object detection system where your model can detect that you are wearing safety kits or not. It is really a important case where people are working in construction sites. Wearing helmets, gloves etc are mandatory. I have tried to build a end to end  yolo model that can detect that you are wearing safety kits or not. 


I have employed Github Actions Continuous Integration and deployment to demostrated a end to end workflow.
